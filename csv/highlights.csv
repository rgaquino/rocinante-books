Little Fires Everywhere,Celeste Ng,"In her parents' house, things had been good or bad, right or wrong, useful or wasteful. There had been nothing in between.

Little Fires Everywhere,Celeste Ng,"""I can save you some time,"" said Ed Lim. ""There really aren't very many. So May Ling has no dolls that look like her, and no books with pictures of people that look like her."" Ed Lim paced a few more steps. Nearly two decades later, others would raise this question, would talk about books as <em>mirrors</em> and  <em>windows</em>, and Ed Lim, tired by then, would find himself as frustrated as he was grateful.  <em>We've always known</em>, he would think;  <em>what took you so long?</em>",,No
Little Fires Everywhere,Celeste Ng,"But the truth was — as Mr. Richardson recognized — that an angry Asian man didn't fit the public's expectations, and was therefore unnerving. Asian men could be socially inept and incompetent and ridiculous, like a Long Duk Dong, or at best unthreatening and slightly buffoonish, like a Jackie Chan. They were not allowed to be angry and articulate and powerful. And possibly right, Mr. Richardson thought uneasily.",,No
Little Fires Everywhere,Celeste Ng,"But the problem with rules, he reflected, was that they implied a right way and a wrong way to do things. When, in fact, most of the time there were simply <em>ways</em>, none of them quite wrong or quite right, and nothing to tell you for sure which side of the line you stood on.",,No
Little Fires Everywhere,Celeste Ng,"""It bothers you, doesn't it?"" Mia said suddenly. ""I think you can't imagine. Why anyone would choose a different life from the one you've got. Why anyone might want something other than a big house with a big lawn, a fancy car, a job in an office. Why anyone would choose anything different that what you'd choose."" Now it was her turn to study Mrs. Richardson, as if the key to understanding her were coded into her face. ""It terrifies you. That you missed out on something. That you gave up something you didn't know you wanted."" A sharp, pitying smile pinched the corners of her lips. ""What was it? Was it a boy? Was it a vocation? Or was it a whole life?""",,No
Little Fires Everywhere,Celeste Ng,"<em>Everything</em>, she had come to understand, was something like infinity.

Little Fires Everywhere,Celeste Ng,"All up and down the streets the houses looked like any others — but inside them were people who might be happy, or taking refuge, or steeling themselves to go out into the world, searching for something better.

Little Fires Everywhere,Celeste Ng,"Years might pass and they might change, both of them, but she was sure she would still know her own child, just as she would know herself, no matter how long it had been.

Find Me,André Aciman,Perhaps going about one's daily life with all its paltry joys and sorrows is the surest way of keeping true life at bay.,,No
Find Me,André Aciman,"To me it proves that life and time are not in sync. It's as if time was all wrong and the wife's life was lived on the wrong bank of the river or, worse yet, on two banks, with neither being the right one. None of us may want to claim to live life in two parallel lanes but all have many lives, one tucked beneath or right alongside the other. some lives wait their turn because they haven't been lived at all, while others die before they've lived out their time, and some are waiting to be relived because they haven't been lived enough. Basically, we don't know how to think of time, because time doesn't really understand time the way we do, because time couldn't care less what we think of time, because time is just a wobbly, unreliable metaphor for how we think about life. Because ultimately it isn't time that is wrong for us, or we for time. It may be life itself that is wrong.",,No

Find Me,André Aciman,"My problem is discovering what not faking is — and this is difficult and scary for me, because my bearings are always pitched to who I ought to be, not to who I am, to what I should have, not to what I never knew I craved, to life as I found it, not to the life I've let myself think was only a dream.",,No
Find Me,André Aciman,"""Love is easy,"" I said. ""It's the courage to love and to trust that matters, and not all of us have both. But what you may not know is that you taught me far more than I've taught you! These vigils, for instance, are perhaps nothing more than my desire to tread in your footsteps, to share with you anything and everything and be in your life as I always want you to be in mine. I've taught you how to earmark moments where time stops, but these moments mean very little unless they're echoed in someone you love.""",,No

Find Me,André Aciman,"We haven't spoken in ages, and I don't know that we're friends, though I'm sure we will always be. He's always read me extremely well, and I have a feeling that he suspects that if I never write it's not because I don't care but because a part of me still does and always will, just as I know he still cares, which is why he too never writes. And knowing this is good enough for me.",,No
Find Me,André Aciman,"Sometimes I want to tell him things, but then I put it off, and even telling myself that I'm putting it off gives me some pleasure, though we may never speak.",,No

Find Me,André Aciman,"But my younger self bungled and sped through so many things. An older self is more frugal, more cautious, and therefore more reluctant — or more desperate — to rush into things he already fears he might never find again.",,No
Find Me,André Aciman,"""Fate, if it exists at all,"" he said, ""has strange ways of teasing us with patterns that may not be patterns at all but that hint at a vestigial meaning still being worked out.""",,No
Find Me,André Aciman,"Then maybe when you get to be my age and the dearth of things life has to offer becomes more evident by the day, maybe then you can start noticing those tiny accidents that turn out to be miracles and that can redefine our lives and cast an incandescent luster over things that, in the great scheme of things, could easily be meaningless. But this is not meaningless.",,No
Find Me,André Aciman,"Because the young teenager still lingers inside me, and occasionally utters a few words, then ducks and goes into hiding. Because he's afraid of asking, because he think you'll laugh that he asked, because even trusting is difficult. I'm shy, I'm scared, and I'm old.",,No
Find Me,André Aciman,"You know, life is not so original after all. It has uncanny ways of reminding us that, even without a God, there is a flash of retrospective brilliance in the way fate plays its cards. It doesn't deal us fifty-two cards; it deals, say, four or five, and they happen to be the same ones our parents and grandparents and great-grandparents played. The cards look pretty frayed and bent. The choice of sequences is limited: at some point the cards will repeat themselves, seldom in the same order, but always in a pattern that seems uncannily familiar. Sometimes the last card is not even played by the one whose life ended. Fate doesn't always respect what we believe is the end of a life. It will deal your last card to those who come after. Which is why I think all lives are condemned to remain unfinished. This is the deplorable truth we all live with. We reach the end and are by no means done with life, not by a long stretch! There are projects we barely started, matters unresolved and left hanging everywhere. Living means dying with regrets stuck in your craw. As the French poet says, Le temps d'apprendre à vivre il est déjà trop tard, by the time we learn to live, it's already too late. And yet there must be some small joy in finding that we are each put in a position to complete the lives of others, to close the ledger they left open and play their last card for them. What could be more gratifying than to know that it will always be up to someone else to complete and round off our life? Someone whom we loved and who loves us enough.",,No
Find Me,André Aciman,"The libido accepts all currencies, and vicarious pleasures have an over-the-counter exchange rate that is considered reliable enough to pass for real. No one ever went bankrupt borrowing someone else's pleasure. We go bankrupt only when we want no one.",,No
Find Me,André Aciman,And some of our fondest desires end up meaning more to us unrealized than tested — don't you think?,,No
Find Me,André Aciman,"Or perhaps what he might have meant was this: If the music doesn't change you, dear friend, it should at least remind you of something profoundly yours that you've probably lost track of but that actually never went away and still answers when beckoned by the right notes, like a spirit gently roused from a prolonged slumber with the right touch of a finger and the right silence between the notes.",,No
Find Me,André Aciman,"<p>Music doesn't give you answers to questions I don't know how to ask. It doesn't tell me what I want. It reminds me that I may still be in love, though I'm no longer sure I know what that means, being in love. I think about people all the time, yet I've hurt many more than I've cared for. I can't even tell what I feel, though feel something I still do, even if it's more like a sense of absence and loss, maybe even failure, numbness, or total unknowing. I was sure of myself once, I thought I knew things, knew myself, and people loved that I reached out to them when I blustered into their lives and didn't even ask or doubt that I mightn't be welcome. Music reminds me of what my life should have been. But it doesn't change me.</p><p>Perhaps, says the genius, music doesn't change us that much, nor does great art change us. Instead it reminds us of who, despite all our claims or denials, we've always known we were and are destined to remain. It reminds us of the mileposts that we've buried and hidden and then lost, of the people and things that mattered despite our lies, despite the years. Music is no more than the sound of our regrets put to a cadence that stirs the illusion of pleasure and hope. It's the surest reminder that we're here for a very short while and that we've neglected or cheated or, worse yet, failed to live our lives. Music is the unlived life. You've lived the wrong life, my friend, and almost defaced the one you were given to live.</p>",,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,"I carried shadows along with me that were unknown to the world of my home. I had had plenty of secrets in the past, and plenty of anxiety, but that was all a game and a joke in comparison with what I was carrying with me into these rooms today. Fate was hounding me, hands were reaching out at me from which my mother couldn't protect me, of which she shouldn't even learn.",,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,"They said that fellows with that mark were weird, and so they were. People with courage and character always seem weird to other people. It was very uncomfortable to have a race of fearless, weird people running around, so now they hung a nickname on that race and made up a story about it in order to take revenge on it, in order to be compensated to some extent for all the fear they had undergone.",,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,I lived in those dreams — I was always a heavy dreamer — more than in real life; those shadows consumed my strength and life.,,No

Demian,Herman Hesse,"Oh, I know it today: nothing in the world is more repugnant to a man than following the path that leads him to himself!",,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,"The insight that my problem was a problem of all mankind, a problem of all life and thought, suddenly passed over me like a sacred shadow; and fear and reverence overpowered me when I saw and suddenly felt how profoundly my very own personal life and opinions shared in the eternal stream of great ideas. The insight was not joyous, even though it somehow made me happy by confirming my opinions. It was tough and tasted raw, because it contained a note of responsibility, of the necessity to cease being a child and to stand on my own feet.",,Yes
Demian,Herman Hesse,"I see that you think more than you can express. But, if that's the case, you must also know that you have never fully lived out your thoughts, and that isn't good. Only the thoughts that we live out have any value.",,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,"Therefore each of us must discover for himself what is permitted and what is forbidden — forbidden to him. It's possible for someone never to do any forbidden thing, and yet be a scoundrel. And vice versa. — Actually, it's merely a question of convenience! Whoever is too comfort-loving to do his own thinking and be his own judge simply adapts to the pre-existing negative commandments. It's easy for him. Others feel commandments of their own within themselves; for them things aren't forbidden which every respectable man does daily, and other things are permissible for them which are normally tabooed. Everyone must stand on his own feet.",,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,"""We're talking too much,"" he said with unaccustomed gravity. ""Smart talk has no value, none at all. It just leads you away from yourself. To depart from yourself is a sin. A person must be able to crawl away into himself completely, like a turtle.""",,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,"But, despite everything, it was almost a pleasure to suffer those torments. I had crawled through life blindly and dully for so long, my heart had kept silent and had sat, impoverished, in a corner for so long, that even these self-accusations, this horror, this whole ghastly emotion in my soul was welcome. After all, it <em>was</em> an emotion, flames were still rising, it showed that my heart was still alive! In a confused way, in the midst of my misery I felt something like liberation and springtime.",,Yes
Demian,Herman Hesse,"And while I was sitting among pools of beer at dirty tables in cheap taverns, entertaining and often frightening my friends with unusually cynical remarks, deep in my heart I revered everything I was mocking, and in my mind I was weeping on my knees before my soul, my past, my mother, and God.",,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,"I did what I had to do, because otherwise I simply had no idea what to do with myself. I was afraid of being alone for long periods; I stood in fear of the numerous tender, shy, warm impulses toward which I constantly felt responsive; I stood in fear of the tender thoughts of love that came to me so frequently.",,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,"But now I had something to love and adore, I once again had an ideal; life was once again filled with presentiments and a mysterious, variegated twilight glow. And that made me insensitive to scorn. Once more I felt at home with myself, although only as a slave and servant of a venerated image.",,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,All I really wanted was to try and live the life that was spontaneously welling up within me. Why was that so very difficult?,,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,"But none of these dreams, none of these thoughts obeyed me; I couldn't summon any of them, I couldn't lend color to any of them at will. They came and took me over; I was governed by them, they lived my life.",,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,"I like music very much, I think, because it's so unconcerned with morality. Everything else is moralistic, and I'm looking for something that isn't.",,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,"The contemplation of such shapes, the surrender to irrational, confused, rare natural forms, engenders in us a feeling that our own mind is in harmony with the will that gave rise to these forms — we soon feel the temptation to look on them as our own caprices, as our own creations —  we see the borderline between us and nature tremble and dissolve, and we become acquainted with the mood in which we don't know whether the images on our retina are coming from external impressions or from within us. In no other way than through this practice do we discover so simply and easily how very creative we are, how much our soul always participates in the perpetual creation of the world.",,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,"We always limit our personality much too narrowly! We always count as pertaining to our person only what we recognize as individual differences that set us apart. But we're comprised of everything that comprises the world, each of us, and just as our body bears within it the lines of evolutionary descent all the way back to the fish and even much farther beyond that, in the same way our soul contains everything that has ever dwelt in human souls.",,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,There's a big difference between merely carrying the world inside you and knowing that you do!,,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,"Now, each one of them has the potentiality of becoming a human being, but only when he senses that potential, when he even learns to be conscious of it to some degree, does that potential belong to him.",,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,Among all my dreams that obscure dream of love was the most loyal.,,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,"When we hate a person, what we hate in his image is something inside ourselves. Whatever isn't inside us can't excite us.",,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,"And we're not pigs, as you think. We're human beings. We create gods and fight with them, and they bless us.",,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,"But in situations where we have made the gift of our love and veneration, not out of long familiarity but out of our most personal impulses; where we have been disciples and friends from the depth of our heart — in such cases it's a bitter and frightening moment when we suddenly seem to realize that the principal current within us is determined to carry us away from the person we love.",,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,"He had never heard me talk like that, and at the very moment I myself realized in a flash with shame and fright that the arrow I had shot at him, striking him to the heart, had been taken from his own arsenal — that I had now maliciously hurled at him in a more pointed form his own self-reproaches, which I had occasionally heard him utter ironically.",,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,"I had often played with images of the future, I had dreamt of roles that might be meant for me, as a poet, perhaps, or as a prophet, or as a painter, or whatever else. That was all meaningless. I didn't exist to write poetry, to preach sermons, to paint pictures; neither I nor anyone else existed for that purpose. All of that merely happened to a person along the way. Everyone had only one true vocation: to find himself.",,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,"""No one ever arrives home,"" she said amiably. ""But when the paths of friends meet, the whole world looks like home for a while.""",,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,"It's always difficult to be born. As you know, the bird must make an effort to break out of the egg. Think back and ask: Was the path really that difficult? Merely difficult? Wasn't it also beautiful? Could you have thought of a more beautiful or easier one?",,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,"""Love ought not to make requests,"" she said, ""but shouldn't make demands, either. Love must have the strength to reach certainty for itself. Then it no longer undergoes the power of attraction, but exerts it.""",,No
Demian,Herman Hesse,"He had loved and, by doing so, had found himself. But most people love in order to lose themselves.",,No
The Man Who Couldn't Stop,David Adam,"It is another vicious cycle: memory uncertainty provokes the need to check, and to check increases memory uncertainty.",,No

The Sparsholt Affair,Alan Hollinghurst,"[A] man of fanatical habits, who worked each day from eight till four, seen by no one but Herta with her lunch tray; who had, like Brahms or Balzac, a coffee-making device and dosed himself into a mania of production, but then emerged and moved, full of remote benignity, among his family; whose children, even so, lived so much in fear of saying the wrong thing that they barely said anything to him at all.",,No

The Sparsholt Affair,Alan Hollinghurst,"A man older than himself whom Johnny had sat next to at dinner last week had told him dating apps were tickets to instant sex, and had shown him two that he used, scores of men a mere hundred yards away, always ready.

The Elephant Vanishes,Haruki Murakami,"“People like Aoki don't scare me. They're all over the place, but I don't trouble myself with them anymore. When I run into them, I don't get involved. I see them coming and I head the other way. I can spot them in an instant. But at the same time, I’ve got to admire the Aokis of this world. Their ability to lay low until the right moment, their knack for latching on to opportunities, their skill in fucking with people’s minds—that’s no ordinary talent. I hate their kind so much it makes me want to puke, but it is a talent.
“No, what really scares me is how easily, how uncritically, people will believe the crap that slime like Aoki deal out. How these Aoki types produce nothing themselves, don’t have an idea in the world, and talk so nice, how this slime can sway gullible types to any opinion and get them to perform on cue, as a group. And this group never entertains even a sliver of doubt that they could be wrong. They think nothing of hurting someone, senselessly, permanently. They don’t take any responsibility for their actions. Them. They’re the real monsters.
They’re the ones I have nightmares about. In those dreams, there’s only the silence. And these faceless people. Their silence seeps into everything like ice water. And then it all goes murky. And I’m dissolving and I’m screaming, but no one hears.”",The Silence,No

You have never known fear until you have a child, and maybe that is what tricks us into thinking that it is more magnificent, because the fear itself is more magnificent. Every day, your first thought is not “I love him” but “How is he?” The world, overnight, rearranges itself into an obstacle course of terrors.

It was two people who remained together, day after day, bound not by sex or physical attraction or money or children or property, but only by the shared agreement to keep going, the mutual dedication to a union that could never be codified.

They would teach you how to live, or at least entertain you while you failed to learn.

The Bluest Eye,Toni Morrison,"But the unquarreled evening hung like the first note of a dirge in sullenly expectant air. An escapade of drunkenness, no matter how routine, had its own ceremonial close. The tiny, undistinguished days that Mrs. Breedlove lived were identified, grouped, and classed by these quarrels. They gave substance to the minutes and hours otherwise dim and unrecalled. They relieved the tiresomeness of poverty, gave grandeur to the dead rooms. In these violent breaks in routine that were themselves routine, she could display the style and imagination of what she believed to be her own true self. To deprive her of these fights was to deprive her of all the zest and reasonableness of life...If Cholly had stopped drinking she would never have forgiven Jesus.

The Bluest Eye,Toni Morrison,"Then they had grown. Edging into life from the back door. Becoming. Everybody in the world was in a position to give them orders. White women said, “Do this.” White children said, “Give me that.” White men said, “Come here.” Black men said, “Lay down.” The only people they need not take orders from were black children and each other. But they took all of that and re-created it in their own image. They ran the houses of white people, and knew it. When white men beat their men, they cleaned up the blood and went home to receive abuse from the victim. They beat their children with one hand and stole for them with the other. The hands that felled trees also cut umbilical cords; the hands that wrung the necks of chickens and butchered hogs also nudged African violets into bloom; the arms that loaded sheaves, bales, and sacks rocked babies into sleep. They patted biscuits into flaky ovals of innocence — and shrouded the dead. They plowed all day and came home to nestle like plums under the limbs of their men. The legs that straddled a mule’s back were the same ones that straddled their men’s hips. And the difference was all the difference there was.",,No

Squatting in a cane field, stooping in a cotton field, kneeling by a river bank, they had carried a world on their heads. They had given over the lives of their own children and tendered their grandchildren. With relief they wrapped their heads in rags, and their breasts in flannel; eased their feet into felt. They were through with lust and lactation, beyond tears and terror. They alone could walk the roads of Mississippi, the lanes of Georgia, the fields of Alabama unmolested. They were old enough to be irritable when and where they chose, tired enough to look forward to death, disinterested enough to accept the idea of pain while ignoring the presence of pain. They were, in fact and at last, free. And the lives of these old black women were synthesized in their eyes — a puree of tragedy and humor, wickedness and serenity, truth and fantasy.",,No

Had he not been alone in the world since he was thirteen, knowing only a dying old woman who felt responsible for him, but whose age, sex, and interests were so remote from his own, he might have felt a stable connection between himself and the children.

In retaining the identity of our race, we held fast to those characteristics most gratifying to sustain and least troublesome to maintain. Consequently we were not royal but snobbish, not aristocratic but class-conscious; we believed authority was cruelty to our inferiors, and education was being at school. We mistook violence for passion, indolence for leisure, and thought recklessness was freedom. We raised our children and reared our crops; we let infants grow, and property develop.

All of us — all who knew her — felt so wholesome after we cleaned ourselves on her. We were so beautiful when we stood astride her ugliness. Her simplicity decorated us, her guilt sanctified us, her pain made us glow with health, her awkwardness made us think we had a sense of humor. Her inarticulateness made us believe we were eloquent.

No, this world of thought was still on this side, and it led to no goal when no one destroyed the senses of the incidental Self but fed it with thoughts and erudition.

Siddhartha,Hermann Hesse,"There is one thought I have had, Govinda, which you will again think is a jest or folly: that is, in every truth the opposite is equally true. For example, a truth can only be expressed and enveloped in words if it is one-sided. Everything that is thought and expressed in words is one-sided, only half the truth; it all lacks totality, completeness, unity. When the Illustrious Buddha taught about the world, he had to divide it into Samsara and Nirvana, into illusion and truth, into suffering and salvation. One cannot do otherwise, there is no other method for those who teach. But the world itself, being in and around us, is never one-sided. Never is a man or a deed wholly Samsara or wholly Nirvana; never is a man wholly a saint or a sinner. This only seems so because we suffer the illusion that time is something real. Time is not real, Govinda. I have realized this repeatedly. And if time is not real, then the dividing line that seems to lie between this world and eternity, between suffering and bliss, between good and evil, is also an illusion.",,No
Siddhartha,Hermann Hesse,"I am a sinner and you are a sinner, but someday the sinner will be Brahma again, will someday attain Nirvana, will someday become a Buddha. Now this ‘someday’ is illusion; it is only a comparison. The sinner is not on the way to a Buddha-like state; he is not evolving, although our thinking cannot conceive things otherwise. No, the potential Buddha already exists in the sinner; his future is already there. The potential hidden Buddha must be recognized in him, in you, in everybody. The world, Govinda, is not imperfect or slowly evolving along a long path to perfection. No, it is perfect at every moment; every sin already carries grace within it, all small children are potential old men, all sucklings have death within them, all dying people - eternal life. It is not possible for one person to see how far another is on the way; the Buddha exists in the robber and the dice player; the robber exists in the Brahmin. During deep meditation it is possible to dispel time, to see simultaneously all the past, present and future, and then everything is good, everything is perfect, everything is Brahman. Therefore, it seems to me that everything that exists is good - death as well as life, sin as well as holiness, wisdom as well as folly. Everything is necessary, everything needs only my agreement, my assent, my loving understanding; then all is well with me and nothing can harm me. I learned through my body and soul that it was necessary for me to sin, that I needed lust, that I had to strive for property and experience nausea and the depths of despair in order to learn not to resist them, in order to learn to love the world, and no longer compare it with some king of desired imaginary world, some imaginary vision of perfection, but to leave it as it is, to love it and be glad to belong to it.",,No
Siddhartha,Hermann Hesse,"This is a stone, and within a certain length of time it will perhaps be soil and from the soil it will become plant, animal or man. Previously I should have said: This stone is just a stone; it has no value, it belongs to the world of Maya, but perhaps because within the cycle of change it can also become man and spirit, it is also of importance. That is what I should have thought. But now I think: This stone is stone; it is also animal, God and Buddha. I do not respect and love it because it was one thing and will become something else, but because it has already long been everything and always is everything. I love it just because it is a stone, because today and not it appears to me a stone. I see value and meaning in each one of its fine markings and cavities, in the yellow, in the gray, in the hardness and the sound of it when I knock it, in the dryness or dampness of its surface. There are stones that feel like oil or soap, that look like leaves or sand, and each one is different and worships Om in its own way; each one is Brahman. At the same time it is every much stone, oily or soapy, and that is just what pleases me and seems wonderful and worthy of worship. But I will say no more about it. Words do not express thoughts very well. They always become a little different immediately they are expressed, a little distorted, a little foolish. And yet it also pleases me and seems right that what is of value and wisdom to one man seems nonsense to another.",,No
Siddhartha,Hermann Hesse,"These are things and one can love things. But one cannot love words. Therefore teachings are of no use to me; they have no hardness, no softness, nor colors, no corners, no smell, no taste - they have nothing but words.

The Rise and Fall of Great Powers,Tom Rachman,"People kept their books, not because they were likely to read them again but because these objects contained the past - the texture of being oneself at a particular place, at a particular time, each volume a piece of one’s intellect, whether the work itself had been loved or despised or had included a snooze on page forty.

The Rise and Fall of Great Powers,Tom Rachman,"Underneath it all, people trust in progress. Scientists will cure their lifestyle disease; the Internet will fix their love lives; technology will solve the oil crisis. Because technology is progress, and progress goes on forever. But progress played a trick. It presented the ultimate gluttony of all: those double clicks that turned everyone into rodents pressing buttons for the next sugar pellet. People who used to deride the losers for watching ten hours of TV a day won’t hesitate to click a mouse for longer. ‘Did she answer my email yet?’ That’s the new obesity. And nobody admits it even happened. The sci-fi movies got it wrong. No robots marched in to enslave humanity. What happened was far more ingenious: the servants became masters by their perfect affability. No microchip was implanted in any human head. People just handed over their brains.

Success is relative: you make a billion while everyone else makes a billion and one, then you just got poorer. Individuals don’t rise together. That's a great lie of our time, like this myth of meritocracy: ‘Work hard enough and you will make it! Just want it enough!’ Everyone <em>does</em> want it enough.

The Old Man And The Sea,Ernest Hemingway,"He remembered the time he had hooked one of a pair of marlin. The male fish always always let the female fish feed first and the hooked fish, the female, made a wild, panic-stricken, despairing fight that soon exhausted her, and all the time the male had stayed with her, crossing the line and circling with her on the surface. He had stayed so close that the old man was afraid he would cut the line with his tail which was sharp as scythe and almost of that size and shape. When the old man had gaffed her and clubbed her, holding the rapier bill with its sandpaper edge and clubbing her across the top of her head until her colour turned to a colour almost like the backing of mirrors, and then, with the boy’s aid, hoisted her aboard, the male fish had stayed by the side of the boat. Then, while the old man was clearing the lines and preparing the harpoon, the male fish jumped high into the air beside the boat, to see where the female was and then went down deep, his lavander wings, that were his pectoral fins, spread wide and all his wide lavender stripes showing. He was beautiful, the old man remembered, and he had stayed.",,No

The Stranger,Albert Camus,"The papers were always talking about the debt owed to society. According to them, it had to be paid. But that doesn’t speak to the imagination. What really counted was the possibility of escape, a leap to freedom, out of the implacable ritual, a wild run for it that would give whatever chance for hope there was. Of course, hope meant being cut down on some street corner as you ran like mad, by a random bullet. But when I really thought it through, nothing was going to allow me such a luxury.

All The Light We Cannot See,Anthony Doerr,"There is pride, too, though - pride that he has done it alone. That his daughter is so curious, so resilient.

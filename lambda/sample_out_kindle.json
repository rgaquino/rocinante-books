    "\u201cIt kind of sickened me. They made a real crappy product by doing it so quick. They could have had Apple.\u201d",
    "\u201cThat was exactly what I needed to hear,\u201d Wozniak later said. \u201cI could stay at the bottom of the organization chart, as an engineer.\u201d",
    "He emphasized that you should never start a company with the goal of getting rich. Your goal should be making something you believe in and making a company that will last.\u201d",
    "Markkula wrote his principles in a one-page paper titled \u201cThe Apple Marketing Philosophy\u201d that stressed three points. The first was empathy, an intimate connection with the feelings of the customer: \u201cWe will truly understand their needs better than any other company.\u201d The second was focus: \u201cIn order to do a good job of those things that we decide to do, we must eliminate all of the unimportant opportunities.\u201d The third and equally important principle, awkwardly named, was impute. It emphasized that people form an opinion about a company or product based on the signals that it conveys.",
    "\u201cThe best way to predict the future is to invent it\u201d",
    "There falls a shadow, as T. S. Eliot noted, between the conception and the creation. In the annals of innovation, new ideas are only part of the equation. Execution is just as important.",
    "\u201cI got a feeling for the empowering aspect of na\u00efvet\u00e9,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t know it couldn\u2019t be done, I was enabled to do it.\u201d",
    "I never worried about money. I grew up in a middle-class family, so I never thought I would starve.",
    "\u201cWhen I went to school, it was right after the sixties and before this general wave of practical purposefulness had set in,\u201d he said. \u201cNow students aren\u2019t even thinking in idealistic terms, or at least nowhere near as much.\u201d",
    "He was self-aware, but that didn\u2019t always modify his behavior.\u201d",
    "\u201cWe learned to interpret \u2018This is shit\u2019 to actually be a question that means, \u2018Tell me why this is the best way to do it.\u2019\u200a\u201d But the story had a coda, which Atkinson also found instructive. Eventually the engineer found an even better way to perform the function that Jobs had criticized. \u201cHe did it better because Steve had challenged him,\u201d said Atkinson, \u201cwhich shows you can push back on him but should also listen, for he\u2019s usually right.\u201d",
    "Recalled Bud Tribble, \u201cWe said to ourselves, \u2018Hey, if we\u2019re going to make things in our lives, we might as well make them beautiful.\u2019\u200a\u201d",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve learned over the years that when you have really good people you don\u2019t have to baby them,\u201d Jobs later explained. \u201cBy expecting them to do great things, you can get them to do great things. The original Mac team taught me that A-plus players like to work together, and they don\u2019t like it if you tolerate B work. Ask any member of that Mac team. They will tell you it was worth the pain.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe current wave of industrial design is Sony\u2019s high-tech look, which is gunmetal gray, maybe paint it black, do weird stuff to it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to do that. But it\u2019s not great.\u201d",
    "\u201cThe main thing in our design is that we have to make things intuitively obvious,\u201d",
    "\u201cGreat art stretches the taste, it doesn\u2019t follow tastes,\u201d",
    "\u201cWhen you\u2019re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you\u2019re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s there, so you\u2019re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.\u201d",
    "\u201cDeciding what not to do is as important as deciding what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s true for companies, and it\u2019s true for products.\u201d",
    "\u201cI hate the way people use slide presentations instead of thinking,\u201d Jobs later recalled. \u201cPeople would confront a problem by creating a presentation. I wanted them to engage, to hash things out at the table, rather than show a bunch of slides. People who know what they\u2019re talking about don\u2019t need PowerPoint.\u201d",
    "Why do we assume that simple is good? Because with physical products, we have to feel we can dominate them. As you bring order to complexity, you find a way to make the product defer to you. Simplicity isn\u2019t just a visual style. It\u2019s not just minimalism or the absence of clutter. It involves digging through the depth of the complexity. To be truly simple, you have to go really deep. For example, to have no screws on something, you can end up having a product that is so convoluted and so complex. The better way is to go deeper with the simplicity, to understand everything about it and how it\u2019s manufactured. You have to deeply understand the essence of a product in order to be able to get rid of the parts that are not essential.",
    "\u201cEngineers are taught to make a decision analytically, but there are times when relying on gut or intuition is most indispensable.\u201d",
    "From the earliest days at Apple, I realized that we thrived when we created intellectual property. If people copied or stole our software, we\u2019d be out of business. If it weren\u2019t protected, there\u2019d be no incentive for us to make new software or product designs. If protection of intellectual property begins to disappear, creative companies will disappear or never get started. But there\u2019s a simpler reason: It\u2019s wrong to steal. It hurts other people. And it hurts your own character.",
    "The older I get, the more I see how much motivations matter. The Zune was crappy because the people at Microsoft don\u2019t really love music or art the way we do. We won because we personally love music. We made the iPod for ourselves, and when you\u2019re doing something for yourself, or your best friend or family, you\u2019re not going to cheese out. If you don\u2019t love something, you\u2019re not going to go the extra mile, work the extra weekend, challenge the status quo as much.",
    "Some people, he added, don\u2019t age well even when they are young.",
    "\u201cSome people resent the fact that Steve gets credit for everything, but I\u2019ve never given a rat\u2019s ass about that,\u201d said Cook. \u201cFrankly speaking, I\u2019d prefer my name never be in the paper.\u201d",
    "\u201cSo, you\u2019ve uncovered the fact that I\u2019m an asshole. Why is that news?\u201d",
    "\u201cThe axis today is not liberal and conservative, the axis is constructive-destructive.",
    "\u201cBy the way, what have you done that\u2019s so great? Do you create anything, or just criticize others\u2019 work and belittle their motivations?\u201d",
    "Nothing kills humor like a general and boring truth.\u201d",
    "I had a real revelation. We were all in robes, and they made some Turkish coffee for us. The professor explained how the coffee was made very different from anywhere else, and I realized, \u201cSo fucking what?\u201d Which kids even in Turkey give a shit about Turkish coffee? All day I had looked at young people in Istanbul. They were all drinking what every other kid in the world drinks, and they were wearing clothes that look like they were bought at the Gap, and they are all using cell phones. They were like kids everywhere else. It hit me that, for young people, this whole world is the same now. When we\u2019re making products, there is no such thing as a Turkish phone, or a music player that young people in Turkey would want that\u2019s different from one young people elsewhere would want. We\u2019re just one world now.",
    "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have social graces, such as putting himself in other people\u2019s shoes, but he cares deeply about empowering humankind, the advancement of humankind, and putting the right tools in their hands.\u201d",
    "I have my own theory about why decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The company starts valuing the great salesmen, because they\u2019re the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company.",
    "I hate it when people call themselves \u201centrepreneurs\u201d when what they\u2019re really trying to do is launch a startup and then sell or go public, so they can cash in and move on. They\u2019re unwilling to do the work it takes to build a real company, which is the hardest work in business. That\u2019s how you really make a contribution and add to the legacy of those who went before. You build a company that will still stand for something a generation or two from now."

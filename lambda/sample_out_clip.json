    "Long before the Industrial Revolution, Homo sapiens held the record among all organisms for driving the most plant and animal species to their extinctions. We have the dubious distinction of being the deadliest species in the annals of biology.",
    "Since we enjoy affluence and security, and since our affluence and security are built on foundations laid by the Agricultural Revolution, we assume that the Agricultural Revolution was a wonderful improvement. Yet it is wrong to judge thousands of years of history from the perspective of today. A much more representative viewpoint is that of a three-year-old girl dying from malnutrition in first-century China because her father\u2019s crops have failed. Would she say \u2018I am dying from malnutrition, but in 2,000 years, people will have plenty to eat and live in big air-conditioned houses, so my suffering is a worthwhile sacrifice\u2019?",
    "How many young college graduates have taken demanding jobs in high-powered firms, vowing that they will work hard to earn money that will enable them to retire and pursue their real interests when they are thirty-five? But by the time they reach that age, they have large mortgages, children to school, houses in the suburbs that necessitate at least two cars per family, and a sense that life is not worth living without really good wine and expensive holidays abroad. What are they supposed to do, go back to digging up roots? No, they double their efforts and keep slaving away.",
    "One of history\u2019s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations. Once people get used to a certain luxury, they take it for granted. Then they begin to count on it. Finally they reach a point where they can\u2019t live without it.",
    "History is something that very few people have been doing while everyone else was ploughing fields and carrying water buckets.",
    "We believe in a particular order not because it is objectively true, but because believing in it enables us to cooperate effectively and forge a better society. Imagined orders are not evil conspiracies or useless mirages. Rather, they are the only way large numbers of humans can cooperate effectively.",
    "Most people do not wish to accept that the order governing their lives is imaginary, but in fact every person is born into a pre-existing imagined order, and his or her desires are shaped from birth by its dominant myths. Our personal desires thereby become the imagined order\u2019s most important defences.",
    "It follows that in order to change an existing imagined order, we must first believe in an alternative imagined order.",
    "Biology is willing to tolerate a very wide spectrum of possibilities. It\u2019s culture that obliges people to realise some possibilities while forbidding others.",
    "Just as when two clashing musical notes played together force a piece of music forward, so discord in our thoughts, ideas and values compel us to think, reevaluate and criticise. Consistency is the playground of dull minds.",
    "\u2018Everyone would work according to their abilities, and receive according to their needs\u2019 turned out in practice into \u2018everyone would work as little as they can get away with, and receive as much as they could grab\u2019.",
    "If, when the mind experiences something pleasant or unpleasant, it simply understands things as they are, then there is no suffering. If you experience sadness without craving that the sadness go away, you continue to feel sadness but you do not suffer from it. There can actually be richness in the sadness. If you experience joy without craving that the joy linger and intensify, you continue to feel joy without losing your peace of mind.",
    "[A]nd that the liberty of individuals is therefore sacrosanct.",
    "So why study history? Unlike physics or economics, history is not a means for making accurate predictions. We study history not to know the future but to widen our horizons, to understand that our present situation is neither natural nor inevitable, and that we consequently have many more possibilities before us than we imagine.",
    "The Scientific Revolution has not been a revolution of knowledge. It has been above all a revolution of ignorance. The great discovery that launched the Scientific Revolution was the discovery that humans do not know the answers to their most important questions.",
    "The real test of \u2018knowledge\u2019 is not whether it is true, but whether it empowers us. Scientists usually assume that no theory is 100 per cent correct. Consequently, truth is a poor test for knowledge. The real test is utility. A theory that enables us to do new things constitutes knowledge.",
    "A good historian can find precedent for everything. But an even better historian knows when these precedents are but curiosities that cloud the big picture.",
    "Most scientific studies are funded because somebody believes they can help attain some political, economic or religious goal.",
    "Science is unable to set its own priorities. It is also incapable of determining what to do with its discoveries.",
    "In short, scientific research can flourish only in alliance with some religion or ideology. The ideology justifies the costs of the research. In exchange, the ideology influences the scientific agenda and determines what to do with the discoveries.",
    "Nobody wants to pay taxes, but everyone is happy to invest.",
    "This is why today a country\u2019s credit rating is far more important to its economic well-being than are its natural resources. Credit ratings indicate the probability that a country will pay its debts. In addition to purely economic data, they take into account political, social and even cultural factors. An oil-rich country cursed with a despotic government, endemic warfare and a corrupt judicial system will usually receive a low credit rating. As a result, it is likely to remain relatively poor since it will not be able to raise the necessary capital to make the most of its oil bounty. A country devoid of natural resources, but which enjoys peace, a fair judicial system and a free government is likely to receive a high credit rating. As such, it may be able to raise enough cheap capital to support a good education system and foster a flourishing high-tech industry.",
    "Consumerism has worked very hard, with the help of popular psychology (\u2018Just do it!\u2019) to convince people that indulgence is good for you, whereas frugality is self-oppression.",
    "The new ethic promises paradise on condition that the rich remain greedy and spend their time making more money, and that the masses give free rein to their cravings and passions \u2013 and buy more and more. This is the first religion in history whose followers actually do what they are asked to do. How, though, do we know that we\u2019ll really get paradise in return? We\u2019ve seen it on television.",
    "When things improve, expectations balloon, and consequently even dramatic improvements in objective conditions can leave us dissatisfied. When things deteriorate, expectations shrink, and consequently even a severe illness might leave you pretty much as happy as you were before.",
    "So maybe Third World discontent is fomented not merely by poverty, disease, corruption and political oppression but also by mere exposure to First World standards.",
    "[F]indings demonstrate that happiness is not the surplus of pleasant over unpleasant moments. Rather, happiness consists in seeing one\u2019s life in its entirety as meaningful and worthwhile.",
    "As Nietzsche put it, if you have a why to live, you can bear almost any how. A meaningful life can be extremely satisfying even in the midst of hardship, whereas a meaningless life is a terrible ordeal no matter how comfortable it is.",
    "What happens to concepts such as the self and gender identity when minds become collective? How could you know thyself or follow your dream if the dream is not in your mind but in some collective reservoir of aspirations?",
    "The only thing we can try to do is to influence the direction scientists are taking. Since we might soon be able to engineer our desires too, perhaps the real question facing us is not \u2018What do we want to become?\u2019, but \u2018What do we want to want?\u2019 Those who are not spooked by this question probably haven\u2019t given it enough thought.",
    "Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don\u2019t know what they want?"

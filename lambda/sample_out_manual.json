    "Till at last the child\u2019s mind <em>is</em> these suggestions, and the sum of the suggestions <em>is</em> the child\u2019s mind. And not the child\u2019s mind only. The adult\u2019s mind too \u2014 all his life long. The mind that judges and desires and decides \u2014 made up of these suggestions. But all these suggestions are <em>our</em> suggestions!",
    "\u2018What I\u2019m going to tell you now,\u2019 he said, \u2018may sound incredible. But then, when you\u2019re not accustomed to history, most facts about the past <em>do</em> sound incredible.\u2019",
    "<p>Family, monogamy, romance. Everywhere exclusiveness, everywhere a focussing of interest, a narrow channelling of impulse and energy.</p><p>\u2019But everyone belongs to everyone else,\u2019 he concluded, citing the hypnopaedic proverb.</p><p>The students nodded, emphatically agreeing with a statement which upwards of sixty-two thousand repetitions in the dark had made them accept, not merely as true, but as axiomatic, self-evident, utterly indisputable.</p>",
    "No wonder those poor pre-moderns were mad and wicked and miserable. Their world didn\u2019t allow them to take things easily, didn\u2019t allow them to be sane, virtuous, happy. What with mother and lovers, what with the prohibitions they were not conditioned to obey, what with the temptations and the lonely remorses, what with all the diseases and the endless isolating pain, what with the uncertainties and the poverty \u2014 they were forced to feel strongly. And feeling strongly (and strongly, what was more, in solitude, in hopelessly individual isolation), how could they be stable?",
    "He was utterly miserable, and perhaps (her shining eyes accused him), perhaps it was his own fault.",
    "There\u2019s so much one doesn\u2019t know; it wasn\u2019t my business to know. I mean, when a child asks you how a helicopter works or who made the world \u2014 well, what are you to answer if you\u2019re a Beta and have always worked in the Fertilizing Room? What <em>are</em> you to answer?",
    "I\u2019d rather be unhappy than have the sort of false, lying happiness you were having here.",
    "One of the principal functions of a friend is to suffer (in a milder and symbolic form) the punishments that we should like, but are unable, to inflict upon our enemies.",
    "Why was that old fellow such a marvelous propaganda technician? Because he had so many insane, excruciating things to get excited about. You\u2019ve got to be hurt and upset; otherwise you can\u2019t think of the really good, penetrating, X-rayish phrases.",
    "But in the intervals I still like him. I shall always like him.",
    "Because our world is not the same as Othello\u2019s world. You can\u2019t make flivvers without steel \u2014 and you can\u2019t make tragedies without social instability. The world\u2019s stable now. People are happy; they get what they want, and they never want what they can\u2019t get. They\u2019re well off; they\u2019re safe; they\u2019re never ill; they\u2019re not afraid of death; they\u2019re blissfully ignorant of passion and old age; they\u2019re plagued with no mothers or fathers; they\u2019ve got no wives, or children, or lovers to feel strongly about; they\u2019re so condition that they practically can\u2019t help behaving as they ought to behave.",
    "Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the over-compensations for misery. And, of course, stability isn\u2019t nearly so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand.",
    "What\u2019s the point of truth or beauty or knowledge when anthrax bombs are popping all around you?",
    "Happiness has got to be paid for. You\u2019re paying for it, Mr Watson \u2014 paying because you happen to be too much interested in beauty. I was too much interested in truth; I paid too.",
    "They say that it is the fear of death and of what comes after death that makes men turn to religion as they advance in years. But my own experience has given me the conviction that, quite apart from any such terrors or imaginings, the religious sentiment tends to develop as we grow older; to develop because, as the passions grow calm, as the fancy and sensibilities are less excited and less excitable, our reason becomes less troubled in its working, less obscured by the images, desires, and distractions, in which it used to be absorbed; whereupon God emerges as from behind a cloud; our soul feels, sees, turns towards the source of all light; turns naturally and inevitably; for now that all that gave to the world of sensations its life and charm has begun to leak away from us, now that phenomenal existence is no more bolstered up by impressions from within or from without, we feel the need to lean on something that abides, something that will never play is false \u2014 a reality, an absolute and everlasting truth. Yes, we inevitably turn to God; for this religious sentiment is of its nature so pure, so delightful to the soul that experiences it, that it makes up to us for all our other losses. (A quote from John Henry Newman)",
    "You can only be independent of God while you\u2019ve got youth and prosperity; independence won\u2019t take you safely to the end.",
    "As if one believed anything by instinct! One believes things because one has been conditioned to believe them.",
    "The gods are just. No doubt. But their code of law is dictated, in the last resort, by the people who organize society; Providence takes its cue from men.",
    "\u2018My dear young friend,\u2019 said Mustapha Mond, \u2018civilization has absolutely no need of nobility or heroism. These things are symptoms of political inefficiency. In a properly organized society like ours, nobody has any opportunities for being noble or heroic. Conditions have got to be thoroughly unstable before the occasion can arise. Where there are wars, where there are divided allegiances, where there are temptations to be resisted, objects of love to be fought for or defended \u2014 there, obviously, nobility and heroism have some sense. But there aren\u2019t any wars nowadays. The greatest care is taken to prevent you from loving anyone too much. There\u2019s no such thing as a divided allegiance; you\u2019re so conditioned that you can\u2019t help doing what you ought to do. And what you ought to do is on the whole so pleasant, so many of the natural impulses are allowed free play, that there really aren\u2019t any temptations to resist.\u2019",
    "<p>\u2018But I like the inconveniences.\u2019</p><p>\u2019We don\u2019t,\u2019 said the Controller. \u2018We prefer to do things comfortably.\u2019</p><p>\u2019But I don\u2019t want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.\u2019</p><p>\u2019In fact,\u2019 said Mustapha Mond, \u2018you\u2019re claiming the right to be unhappy.\u2019</p><p>\u2019All right, then,\u2019 said the Savage defiantly, \u2018I\u2019m claiming the right to be unhappy.\u2019</p>",
    "In spite of their sadness \u2014 because of it even; for their sadness was the symptom of their love for one another \u2014 the three young men were happy.",
    "The work gave him an intense pleasure. After those weeks of idleness in London, with nothing to do, whenever he wanted anything, but to press a switch or turn a handle, it was pure delight to be doing something that demanded skill and patience."
